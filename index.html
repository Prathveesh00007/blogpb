Nearby, chic bars serve everything from local beer to cocktails, while the white marble ISKCON temple serves up vegetarian fare and baked goods. Contemporary and experimental plays take the stage at Prithvi Theatre.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Qutab Minar is a soaring, 73 m-high tower of victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak immediately after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu kingdom. The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony and tapers from a 15 m diameter at the base to just 2.5 m at the top. The first three storeys are made of red sandstone; the fourth and fifth storeys are of marble and sandstone. At the foot of the tower is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the first mosque to be built in India. An inscription over its eastern gate provocatively informs that it was built with material obtained from demolishing '27 Hindu temples'. A 7 m-high iron pillar stands in the courtyard of the mosque. It is said that if you can encircle it with your hands while standing with your back to it your wish will be fulfilled.</p>

                </h5>
                <p>The debut of “Stranger Things” in 2016 marked the first real, huge streaming TV phenomenon. Other Netflix shows had made an impression before: “House of Cards” in 2013 and “Orange Is the New Black” shortly thereafter proved that streaming was coming for cable’s gig, hard. But it was the nostalgia grabs and exhilarating monster chases of “Stranger Things” that truly exploded in the zeitgeist — which is the only concrete factor we have to go on, given Netflix’s famous reticence to disclose viewership numbers. </p>

                </h5>
                <p>The show is great whether you like sci-fi or not the story is great and keeps you entertaining throughout.

                    The first season is simple a colony of humans go for a trip to the nearest star to our sun alpha centauri (yes i did some research) and a alien AI Robot attack happens and they get stranded on a solar system unknown where they take refuge on a planet little and about there way to find a way back to civilization.
                    The second season start is disappointing as it made no sense at all and had too many plot points although many of them are solved by the end but still many were unresolved but further the season 2 has lot going for it particularly the all women they had an important role this season.
                    The CGI is on point and the worlds look gorgeous and the life that they have shown.They did a great job on the robot it looked stunning.The visuals of most of the planets and other nature shots will stun you as they are beautifully made.
                    The first season ended on a cliff hanger and so does the second and every episode i guess ended on a note that wants you to come back for more.This is why it becomes a good show as it constantly makes you come back for more. </p>

                <p>A great masterpiece...The best animated movie I ever saw. The vivid display of emotions like humor, frustration, love...this movie is magical; a fantasy which I would love to live in.
                    The characters are amazing. A bit off from the book, yes ,but perfectly fitting for the movie. The OG six which includes Hiccup, Astrid, Snotlout, Fishlegs, Ruffnut and Tuffnut each build up their character in a way such that a single dialog of theirs is enough to convey the aspect of their personality(Astrid: A headstrong warrior lady, Snotlout: Hotheaded boy/man, Fishlegs: The quiet dragon nerd, Ruffnut and Tuffnut: Humorous Twins and Hiccup: The boy who became a hero...the hard way.

                    The diversity and variety of dragons is unique. Going off from the stereotypical dragon was a big challenge for the movie but a great success.

In this beloved revised classic, beginning readers and budding astronomers are launched on a wild trip to visit the eight planets in our solar system (per the International Astronomical Union’s 2006 decision to downgrade Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet), along with the Cat in the Hat, Thing One, Thing Two, Dick, and Sally. It’s a reading adventure that’s out of this world!<br>
